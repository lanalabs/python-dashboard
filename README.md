# python-dashboard
A documented example for python dashboards that can be used as a starting point for any new dashboards.

## Uploading new source-code
First stop tracking the ```upload.sh``` file so that you can change the file without pushing the changes to git by accident.  
```git update-index --assume-unchanged upload.shÂ´ ```  
After filling in the api_key, dashboard_id and url, open the terminal and run  
```bash upload.sh```
